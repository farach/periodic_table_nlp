# **Periodic Table of Natural Language Processing Tasks** in R

[![Periodic Table of NLP
tasks](images/periodic-table-of-nlp-tasks-high.png "Periodic Table of NLP tasks")](https://www.innerdoc.com/periodic-table-of-nlp-tasks/)

This project is an attempt to expand on [Rob van
Zoest](https://www.innerdoc.com/author/rob-van-zoest/)’s [Periodic Table
of NLP tasks
project](https://www.innerdoc.com/periodic-table-of-nlp-tasks/). The
goal is to document each of these NLP tasks from an R language
perspective as much as possible.

The Periodic Table of Natural Language Processing Tasks is “a project to
build a mini guide with more than 80 helpful NLP task descriptions!
Structured in the format of the Periodic Table”.

Each of these 80+ tasks are split into 15 groups. Rob has already
provided a ton of information on these tasks and has put together a
helpful website where users can click through to get more information.

Let’s learn all about NLP in R!
